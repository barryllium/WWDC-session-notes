### **Identity**

View Identity

* Views that share the same identity represent different states of the same UI element
* Views that represent distinct UI elements will always have different identities

**Types of Identity - Explicit and Structural Identity**

Explicit identity

* Assigned identifiers (such as name or pointer identity)
* SwiftUI does not use pointers for identity
* In a ForEach, the id: dictates the item’s explicit identity
* In a ScrollViewReader, you can use the explicit .id() modifier

Structural identity

* In SwiftUI, every view has an identifier, and this is where structural identity comes in
* For views that don’t move, SwiftUI uses their relative arrangement of views to distinguish them from each other
* Only works if SwiftUI can guarantee these views won’t swap
* Implicitly uses @ViewBuilder
￼

Using if/else causes views to transition in and out. When possible, use a single view with different parameters/modifiers

* This will preserve state by using a single identifier
￼

Avoid AnyView whenever possible

* It is a type erasing wrapper type
* Hides type of the view it is wrapping from its generic signature
* Makes code harder to understand
* Fewer compile-time diagnostics without AnyView

Bad code example:
￼
```
func view(for dog: Dog) -> some View {
	var dogView: AnyView
	if dog.breed == .bulldog {
		dogView = AnyView(BulldogView())
	} else if dog.breed == .pomeranian {
		dogView = AnyView(PomeranianView())
	} else if dog.breed == .borderCollie {
		dogView = AnyView(BorderCollieView())
		if sheepNearby {
			dogView = AnyView(HStack {
				dogView
				SheepView()
			})
		}
	} else {
		dogView = AnyView(UnknownBreedView())
	}
	return dogView
}
```

Good code example:
￼
```
@ViewBuilder
func view(for dog: Dog) -> some View {
	switch dog.breed {
		case .bulldog:
			BulldogView()
		case .pomeranian:
			PomeranianView()
	case .borderCollie:
		HStack {
			BorderCollieView()
			if sheepNearby {
				SheepView)
			}
		}
	default:
		UnknownBreedView)
	}
}
```

### **LifeTime**

View value != view identity
When a view is first created, it is given an identity

* Over time, new values for the view are created, but the view is still the same (identity)
* onDisappear is when the view’s lifetime ends

@State and @StateObject are persisted for the lifetime of the View

* When using if/else to show/hide views, each view gets its own set of State/StateObject
* So if you have two instances of a view that show/hide, they do not share the same values/identity unless those values are passed in
￼
![](images/demystify/lifetime.png)

State lifetime = View lifetime

A view’s value is short-lived
A views’s lifetime is the duration of its identity
Persistence of state is tied to lifetime
Provide a stable identity for your data

* ForEach depends on this (amongst other things in SwiftUI)


### **Dependencies**

Dependencies are an input for a view

* When dependencies change, the view is required to produce a new body
* Actions are what trigger changes to a view’s dependencies
￼

Dependency graph

* Underlying representation of SwiftUI views
* Identity is the backbone of the graph
* Efficiently updates the UI
* Value comparison reduces body generation

Kinds of dependencies

* @Binding
* @Environment
* @State
* @StateObject
* @ObservedObject
* @EnvironmentObject

Identifier stability

* Directly impacts lifetime
* Helps performance
* Minimizes dependency churn
* Avoids state loss
* An identifier should not change over time

Identifier uniqueness

* Each id should be mapped to a single view
* Improves animation
* Also helps performance
* Correctly reflects dependencies

The code below has a problem - once the condition is met, the view will get a new identifier
￼
￼￼![](images/demystify/identifier1.png)

Moving the condition inside the opacity modifier will fix the issue and improve performance
￼

An opacity of 1.0 is an inert modifier, and allows SwiftUI to remove the modifier and improve performance
