# **What's new in Swift**

**Community update**

* Workgroup support for
	* Swift on Server
	* Diversity in Swift
	* Swift website
	* C++ Interopability
* Mentorships available
![](images/swift/mentorships.png)
* Standard library smaller, dropped dependency on third party unicode library, replaced with native library

---

**Swift Packaging**

* SPM has added "trust on first use" (TOFU) for downloading package for increased security
* Package Plugins
	* Command plugins
		* documentation generation
		* reformat source code 
		* generate test reports
	* DocC adds Obj-C and C support
	* Build tool plugins
		* provide scalable way for packages to define plugins that can implement additional build steps
		* examples - source code generation, resource processing

**Performance Improvements**

* Module disambiguation
	* allows you to rename modules from outside the packages that define them. 
![](images/swift/module_disambiguation.png)
* Swift driver settings
	* Integrated compiler
	* Eager compilation
	* Eager linking
	* Demystify parallelization in Xcode builds #session
* Build-time improvements
	* New swift driver settings
	* Faster type checking of generics
* Runtime improvements
	* Optimized protocol conformance checking
* Improve app size and runtime performance #session

---

**Concurrency**

* Improvements to the concurrency model
	* Back deployed to iOS 13
* Extensions to the model
	* Data race avoidance
		* Eliminate data races using Swift concurrency #session
	![](images/swift/concurrency1.png)
	![](images/swift/concurrency2.png)
* Distributed actors
	* actors for code that can be between processes or even devices
	![](images/swift/distributed_actors.png)
	* Distrubuted Actors package
		* Makes distributed systems in Swift easier to write
		* Integrated networking solution
		* Integrated consensus protocol
	* Meet distributed actors in Swift #session
* Async Algorithms package
	* Seamless integration with async/await
	* Home for time-based algorithms using `AsyncSequence`
	* Support on Apple platforms, Linux, and Windows
	* Meet Swift Async Algorithms #session
* Concurrency optimizations
	* Actor prioritization
	* Priority-inversion avoidance
* Swift concurrency instruments
	* Visualize and optimize Swift security

---

**Expressive Swift**

* Unwrapping optionals - old code vs. new code below
	* works with guard and while as well
```
if let workingDirectoryMailmapURL = workingDirectoryMailmapURL {
	mailmapLines = try String(contentsOf: workingDirectoryMailmapURL).split(separator:
}

if let workingDirectoryMailmapURL {
	mailmapLines = try String(contentsOf: workingDirectoryMailmapURL).split(separator:
}
```
	
* Closure type inference
	* Have to define your closure result type less often now - `type in -> [String]` becomes `type in`
	* Permitted pointer conversions
	![](images/swift/pointer_conversions.png)
* String parsing
	* Regex literals: old code vs. new code:
```
// Old way
let line = "Becca Royal-Gordon <beccarg@apple.com>          # Comment"

func parseLine(_ line: Substring) throws -> MailmapEntry {
	func trim(_ str: Substring) -> Substring {
		String(str).trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)[...]
	}
	
	let activeLine = trim(line[..<(line.firstIndex(of: "#") ?? line.endIndex)])
	guard let nameEnd = activeLine.firstIndex(of:"<"),
			let emailEd = activeLine[nameEnd...].firstIndex(of: ">"),
			trim(activeLine[activeLine.index(after: emailEnd)...]).isEmpty else {
		throw MailmapError.badLine
	}
	let name = nameEnd == activeLine.startIndex ? nil : trim(activeLine[..<nameEnd])
	let email = activeLine[activeLine.index(after:nameEnd)..<emailEnd]

	return MailmapEntry(name: name, email: email)
}

// New way
func parseLine( line: Substring) throws -> MailmapEntry {
	let regex = (Ah*([<#]+?)??\h*<([*>#]+)>\h*(?:#|\Z)/
	guard let match = line.prefixMatch(of: regex) else {
		throw MailmapError.badLine
	}
	
	return MailmapEntry(name: match.1, email: match.2)
}
```
* Or, even more readable - use RegexBuilder
```
import RegexBuilder

let regex = Regex {
	ZeroOrMore(.horizontalWhitespace)
	Optionally {
		Capture (OneOrMore(.noneOf("<#")))
	}
	.repetitionBehavior(.reluctant)
	
	ZeroOrMore(.horizontalWhitespace)
	"<"
	Capture (OneOrMore(.noneOf(">#")))
	">"
	ZeroOrMore(.horizontalWhitespace)
	Choiceof {
		"#"
		Anchor.endofSubjectBeforeNewline
	}
}
```

		* You can turn a regex into a reusable regex component (similar to turning a SwiftUI hierarchy into a view)
		* Support dropping string literals right into a builder without special characters
		* Can use regex literals in the middle of a builder
		* Types like dates can integrate custom parsing logic with regex builders, and even convert the data to a richer type before capturing it
		* Swift Regex is an open source custom engine
			* Literal dialect based on UTS #18 with extensions
			* iOS 16 only
* Generic code clarity
	* `any` keyword to make code more readable and define conformance
	![](images/swift/generics1.png)
	![](images/swift/generics2.png)
	![](images/swift/generics3.png)
	* Primary associated types
		* can put the element type of any collection in angle brackets using the `any` keyword
	![](images/swift/primary_type.png)
	* Improvements to any types
		* The `any` keyword
		* Pass to generic arguments
		* Supports `Self` and associated types
		* Primary associated types
		* **but** you still shouldn't use them when generics will work
			* to make generic code easier to write, you can now use the `some` keyword: old code vs. new code
