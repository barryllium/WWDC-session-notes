* Privacy pillars
    * Data minimization
    * On-device processing
    * Transparency and control
    * Security protections

### **New pickers**

### **Upgraded protections**

* Private Wi-Fi
    * Private wi-fi controls for MAC address rotation on iOS
    * Bringing MAC address protection to macOS
    * Private Wi-Fi addresses now rotate on iOS and macOS
        * iOS will use random, per-network MAC addresses
        * When `Rotate Wi-Fi Address` is on for a network, the MAC address will change approximately every two weeks
        * Addresses for forgotten networks will always rotate after at most 24 hours
    * For public networks, the Rotate Wi-Fi Address setting will default ot a static rotating address
    * In iOS 18, in Wi-Fi settings, `Private Wi-Fi Address` is now `Rotate Wi-Fi Address`
    * Now provides MAC address rotation in addition to random initialization
    * Default state and behavior of the toggle is based ont eh type of the network a device is connected to
* macOS extensions
    * macOS now provides a system notification when extensions are installed
    * Extensions can still be disabled in `Login Items & Extensions`
    * Now support for additional types of extensions:
        * Spotlight importers
        * Dock tiles
        * Smart card reader devices
        * Color panels
        * Media extensions
        * Cron (disabled by default)
    * Login items and extensions now live in a single place in macOS System Settings - `General -> Login Items & Extensions`
    * Directory Services plug-in, legacy QuickLook plug-ins, and com.apple.loginitems.plist are no longer supported
* App group container protection
    * Brings protections of sandboxing to groups of apps, and apps that aren't ready to sandbox all of their data yet
    * If one app tries to access another app's container, a prompt is presented to allow ro deny access
        * This now extends to shared containers for a group of multiple apps
    * Protected group containers can now be used to protect a subset of the data for an app
    * Best practices
        * Declare app groups entitlement
        * Format identifiers correctly
        * Use only `containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)` to get the path to the shared container
