```swift
@Test
func continent() async throws {
    let videoLibrary = try await VideoLibrary()
    let video = try #require(await videoLibrary.video(named: "Scotland Coast"))
}


@Test ("Continents mentioned in videos",
    .tags(.location) ,
    arguments: [
        ("A Beach",                 [Continent.oceania]),
        ("By the Lake",             [.europe]),
        ("Camping in the Woods",    [.northAmerica, .asia]),
        ("Ocean Breeze",            [.oceania]),
        ("Patagonia Lake",          [.southAmerica]),
        ("China Paddy Field",       [.asia]),
        ("Scotland Coast",          [.europe]),
        ("Grand Canyon Evening",    [.northAmerica]),
        ("Liwa Horizon",            [.asia]),
    ])

func continent (videoName: String, expectedContinents: [Continent]) async throws {
    let videoLibrary = try await VideoLibrary()
    let video = try #require(await videoLibrary.video(named: videoName))
    #expect(video.mentionedContinents == expectedContinents)
}
```
